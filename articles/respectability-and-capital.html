      <h2>The Economic Logic of "Acting Right"</h2>

      <p>Respectability politics is typically discussed as a cultural or moral phenomenon — a set of behavioral prescriptions that circulate within Black communities regarding speech, dress, comportment, and public self-presentation. The standard critique identifies these prescriptions as a form of internalized oppression: the adoption of white behavioral norms as a survival strategy that ultimately reinforces the legitimacy of those norms. This critique is correct as far as it goes. It does not go far enough.</p>

      <p>The deeper function of respectability politics is economic. Every behavioral adjustment that respectability demands carries a cost. The cost is denominated in time, in cognitive labor, in the suppression of authentic expression, and in direct financial expenditure. The question that is rarely asked is where this expenditure flows. Who captures the value generated by millions of Black Americans engaged in the perpetual labor of self-modification?</p>

      <h2>The Infrastructure of Presentation</h2>

      <p>Consider the material requirements of respectability as it is actually practiced. Professional dress codes that demand specific brands, fabrics, and styles. Hair standards that require chemical treatments, specialized salons, or the adoption of protective styles that themselves require significant investment. Speech patterns that necessitate a second linguistic register maintained through constant self-monitoring. Educational credentials pursued less for their intellectual content than for their signaling function.</p>

      <p>Each of these requirements generates a revenue stream. The industries that service Black respectability — professional attire, hair care, elocution, credentialing — collectively represent billions in annual expenditure. This expenditure is frequently celebrated as evidence of Black economic participation. Rarely is it analyzed as a tax — a compulsory payment extracted as the price of admission to economic spaces that white Americans access without equivalent cost.</p>

      <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>

      <p>The mechanism sustains itself through a feedback loop. Those Black individuals who invest most heavily in respectability and achieve some measure of institutional success become the most vocal advocates for the same behavioral prescriptions, because their personal narratives confirm the efficacy of the approach. The surgeon who credits his success to his mother's insistence on proper grammar becomes an ambassador for the very system that extracted disproportionate cost from his family. His testimony obscures the structural reality: that the grammar was never the operative variable, and that the institution would have found other grounds for exclusion had that particular criterion been met.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, those who refuse or cannot afford the investment are positioned as evidence that the behavioral prescriptions were necessary. Their exclusion is cited as proof of the system's meritocratic function, when in fact it demonstrates the system's extractive one.</p>

      <h2>Toward an Alternative Calculus</h2>

      <p>The alternative is to calculate the true cost of respectability and to weigh it against the actual return. When this accounting is performed honestly, the yield is negative for the vast majority of participants. The rational economic response to a negative-yield investment is divestment — the reallocation of resources toward strategies that generate positive returns under conditions that do not require self-negation as a prerequisite.</p>

      <p>What those strategies look like in practice is the subject of ongoing experimentation within Black economic thought. The relevant point here is that the first step is the recognition that respectability is a cost center, and that the beneficiaries of that cost are largely external to the communities that bear it.</p>
